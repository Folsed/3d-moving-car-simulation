# Moving Car Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of a moving car built using Next.js and React Three.js. It demonstrates the basics of 3D animation and scene rendering in a web environment. By leveraging React Three.js, the project displays a car model that moves smoothly, providing an interactive and visually engaging experience. The project was developed solely for educational purposes and for the personal interest of developing 3D websites.
